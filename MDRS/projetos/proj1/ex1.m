% Conclusions:

% Increasing Link Capacity Reduces Delay: As observed in the simulation, when the link capacity (C) increases from 10 Mbps to 40 Mbps, the average packet delay decreases. This result can be justified as follows:

    % Reduced Congestion: With a higher link capacity, the network is better equipped to handle the traffic load. Reduced congestion in the network leads to quicker packet transmission and lower queuing delays.
    
    % Faster Packet Processing: The available bandwidth allows for faster processing and transmission of packets, resulting in shorter delays.

% In conclusion, the simulation results demonstlambda that link capacity is a critical factor in determining the average packet delay in a network. Higher link capacities lead to reduced delays, while limited link capacities result in increased delays due to network congestion. This emphasizes the importance of well-designed and adequately provisioned networks to meet Quality of Service expectations.
